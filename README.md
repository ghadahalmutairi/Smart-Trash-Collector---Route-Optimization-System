# Smart-Trash-Collector---Route-Optimization-System
📌 Project OverviewUrban waste collection often suffers from inefficiencies due to static, fixed routes that lead to wasted fuel, time, and human effort1. Our team developed the Smart Trash Collector, an intelligent route-planning system that dynamically optimizes collection paths based on real-time coordinates2. By minimizing travel distance, we aim to reduce operational costs and carbon emissions, contributing to a cleaner and more sustainable urban environment333333333.🚀 Key FeaturesDynamic Path Planning: Replaces traditional manual routing with automated algorithmic solutions4444.Algorithmic Comparison: Provides a rigorous evaluation between local (Nearest Neighbor) and global (Genetic Algorithm) optimization methods5555.Scalability Testing: Performance verified across datasets ranging from 5 to 1,000 collection points6666.Performance Visualization: Includes execution time graphs and route distance analysis using Matplotlib777.🛠️ Tech StackLanguage: Python8.Libraries: NumPy (Data Processing), Pandas (Data Manipulation), Matplotlib (Visualization)9.Optimization Techniques: Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Nearest Neighbor (NN)10101010.🧠 Algorithmic ImplementationOur team implemented and compared two distinct approaches:1. Simple Algorithm: Nearest Neighbor (NN)Logic: A greedy approach that always selects the closest unvisited point11.Complexity: Time complexity of $O(n^2)$ and Space complexity of $O(n)$12121212.Best For: Small-scale problems where speed is the primary concern13.2. Optimized Algorithm: Genetic Algorithm (GA)Logic: An evolutionary technique utilizing selection, crossover, and mutation to explore a global search space14.Crossover & Mutation: Custom-built functions to merge parent routes and apply random swap mutations to prevent local optima stagnation.Complexity: Time complexity of $O(G \times P \times n \times \log P)$ and Space complexity of $O(P \times n)$15151515.📊 Empirical ResultsAccuracy: The Genetic Algorithm consistently produced shorter, more optimized routes compared to the Nearest Neighbor as the number of points increased16161616.Efficiency: While Nearest Neighbor remains faster in execution time, the Genetic Algorithm's accuracy makes it the superior choice for real-world logistics17171717.💻 Code Structuregenetic.py: Implementation of the GA engine, fitness evaluation, and evolutionary operations.nearest_neighbor.py: Implementation of the greedy baseline algorithm.👥 Contributors (Team Members)Ghadah Almutairi 18Aknan Alshubrumi 19Tala Albishri 20Jawaher Alharbi
